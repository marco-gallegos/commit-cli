# Git Commmit Cli

This project provides a cli to make git commits with a minimized [odoo format](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/reference/guidelines.html#git) from a text wizard.

Is a wrapper of the `git commit -m` command writed with ðŸ’Ÿ on Python.

This was tested on a raspbian and a fedora OS with the nano, nvim and vim editor.

supported formats:

- short odoo
- conventional commits
- free (this is like use native `git commit` command)

## Features

### Commitcli configuration file per project

You can add a `.commitclirc` file in your project directory.

you can copy the global `.commitclirc` file to your project directory and edit it to use a diferent format.

```shell
cp ~/.commitclirc .commitclirc
```

## Installation

#### 1 - Install the package

note : use sudo if the local (user) python bin dir is not in the path

```shell
sudo pip install commitcli
```

example content of the `.commitclirc` file:
```shell
#Format for every commit
#supported formats free, odoo, sgc(semantic git commits) and cc (conventional commits)
format=odoo

#Option to sign the commits o every commit, must be True or False
signgpg=False
```

change this to use cc on your project:
```shell
#Format for every commit
#supported formats free, odoo, sgc(semantic git commits) and cc (conventional commits)
format=cc

#Option to sign the commits o every commit, must be True or False
signgpg=False
```

save this file and add to your git repository and every comand will use cc format on this project.

#### 2 - Enjoy

```shell
git add .
```

```shell

```
